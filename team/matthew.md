Hi, I'm Matthew. I am a 2nd year computer science student. My favorite color is blue and I am from the Bay Area. One of the goals I have for this project is to learn how to function / coordinate within a team.

APP IDEAS: 
A great feature to implement is notifying the user 30 mins before their bedtime in order to give them time to wind down and sleep on time. 
One possible way to enforce that they are not using other apps is to force the user to stay on the app page in order to count as "sleeping"
