My name is Hyewon Seong, a CS major at UCSB.  

An app feature that I think might be useful to implement is to have tips appear along with the schedule/times outputting as the user is using the app.  The tips can hold information about the ideal amount of hours of sleep that should be gotten a night, suggestions or methods of falling asleep, how long it takes an average person to fall asleep, etc.  That way they will not have to go to outside sources to find/decide those things.
